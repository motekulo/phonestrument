Comments from alex:

master off switch in the action bar, and mute switches on independent voices/synths (although that could be at the mixer even?)

The clear aspect of the synth wasn't obvious - maybe separate boxes with crosses?

Need to be able to limit the number of beats, and also have graphic representation of the subdivision.
