There are lots of music apps, but very few of them are open source. In an
increasingly dominant/widespread OS, having open source apps offers long
lasting accessible opportunities to make music production more widely available
to more people.

As an ethnomusicologist I am interested in the impact technology is having
world wide. My own particular interest has been focused on popular music
production in Melanesia, mainly Papua New Guinea. Mobile phones have
transformed communication in this region since about 2007. As smartphones
become more widespread (and Android phones in particular due to their lower
price that iPhones) we can expect apps to have a bigger influence in a number
of areas, music being one of them.

There are some useful, thoughtful, ideas originally penned by Jonathan Sterne, and endorsed by lots of people interested in music technology and scholarship here:
