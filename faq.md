_Android has awful audio latency - why even bother?_

: While iOS is currently much better for creating audio applications, one of
the aims of this project is to get people in places like Melanesia (so the
"Global South" if you like) using it, and Android has the numbers. This means
that realtime apps are out of the question for the moment. A recent attempt at
a oneshot sample player resulted in ridiculous and unpredictable latency. It's
unfortunate, but that's the state of the OS at the moment. Maybe things will
improve.

_Why open source?_

: So it might garner assistance from others and to have the possibility of a
longer life.

_Hasn't this been done before?_

: Not for Android as far as I know
