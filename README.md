Touch based phone instrument for Android

The basic idea is to develop an instrument that provides a selected tonal palette based on key and chord selection. Select a key, select a chord (and eventually any modifications) then use the grid to create a sequence.

Pdlib is used as the main music/synth engine.

The synth is basically a minor modification of the tutorial provided by Andy Parnell at http://www.obiwannabe.co.uk/html/music/6SS/six-simple-synthesisers.html
