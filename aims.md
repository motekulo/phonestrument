# Stage 1

Create an app that allows people to compose/write simple songs and pieces
involving drums, chord/arpeggio instruments, bass, and lead/melody.

The insipiration for this stems from various songs composed by Melanesian
artists with themes supporting West Papuan Independence and posted to Youtube.

# Stage 2

Connect instances of the app over networks, to allow shared performance and
creation of music. OSC is the most likely protocol to be used for this at the
moment.

# Stage 3

Test, modify, release, test, modify, release... and so on.
